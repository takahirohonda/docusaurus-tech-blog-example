# What You Need To Know About SAM Templates

AWS SAM template is a thin abstraction of a CloudFormation template to develop and deploy lambda by a AWS tool, SAM (Serverless Application Model). It has shorter syntax compared to writing infrastructure as code with CloudFormation. We still do a little bit of learning when it comes to writing SAM templates. Using `sam init` will create a template, so it is a good starting point. Then we can build the template according to our needs.

Now I have created a Reference github on SAM Templates. It is a comprehensive reference to SAM templates and SAM CLI. If you are interested in developing and deploying lambda with SAM, this might help you to get started!
